"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Max was downgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday evening, bearing down on a region with the popular tourist resorts of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa.  Max s maximum sustained winds decreased to 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour) on Thursday evening, and the storm was about 80 miles (129 km) east of Acapulco, the National Hurricane Center in Florida said. The storm is expected to continue weakening dramatically as it moves inland over Southern Mexico, and it will likely be downgraded to a tropical depression on Thursday evening.  Nevertheless, the center warned of heavy rains and flooding in the coastal states of Guerrero and Oaxaca.  In the state of Guerrero, home to some of Mexico s major tourist resorts, Max could dump as much as 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in coastal areas, the NHC said, potentially triggering flash floods and mudslides.  The storm is bad news for Acapulco as tourists prepare to travel to the city to celebrate Mexico s Independence Day this weekend.  Meanwhile, tropical storm Norma formed in the Pacific on Thursday, according to the NHC. The storm, which is currently 360 miles (579 km) south of Cabo San Lucas, on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, could become a hurricane by late Friday.  Max arrives a week after a powerful 8.1-magnitude quake shook southern Mexico, destroying thousands of buildings in the state of Oaxaca and killing at least 98 people nationwide. ",1

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With a swipe of his pen, U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday started killing off a retirement advice rule that wealth managers from Wall Street to Wisconsin have spent the last six years lobbying against. A landmark policy from the Obama era, the so-called fiduciary rule requires brokers and financial advisers to act in the best interest of retirement savers. This restricts their ability to earn commissions and to sell some higher-fee products. Wall Street has argued it would harm consumers because it would raise compliance costs and therefore fees, and force them to get rid of Main Street clients and small businesses that offer 401(k) plans. Trump’s executive order asks the Labor Department to review whether the rule needs to be changed or dumped. Both supporters and opponents are girding to argue their case. But the industry has the edge, with Trump officials stating they were planning on rolling back regulation generally and criticizing the fiduciary rule in particular. The Chamber of Commerce, one of a number of trade groups which have filed lawsuits to kill the rule, cheered Trump’s order. “We look forward to swift action from the Department of Labor in putting this delay into effect and reevaluating matters of policy and law,” the Chamber said in a statement. Shares of banks with large wealth management divisions jumped on Friday with Bank of America (BAC.N) up 2.5 percent, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) 5.5 percent stronger and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) over 2 percent higher. Insurers, whose sales of annuity products were at risk from the rule, also rose, with shares of Prudential (PRU.N) up 1.9 percent and Metlife (MET.N) 1 percent stronger. “Everyone will be pleased that DOL’s rush to get it done before the administration change is set back,” said Judi Carsrud, director of government relations for the National Association of Insurance Financial Advisors (NAIFA), which has been fighting the rule for years. NAIFA plans to pursue a “very straightforward” fix such as a “legislative approach” that directs retirement account advisers to act in clients’ best interest – a standard that Carsrud believes the group’s members already meet. The Obama administration had said conflicted advice costs American families $17 billion a year but the industry has said that figure was inflated. No-one disputes the high cost that firms would have to pay to comply with the new rule, an amount the Labor Department estimates at as much as $31 billion over the next decade. Banks have already started changing things with Bank of America saying this week it would more clearly disclose the fees it charges clients of its Merrill Lynch wealth management business. Bank of America Corp had already started cutting back on “transactional” accounts that charge clients a commission for every trade, rather than a flat fee based on assets. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has decided to keep such accounts but is making changes that will allow advisers to work within the rule’s confines by creating new contracts, re-training advisors and updating supervisory software. Swiss bank UBS UBSN.VX welcomed Trump’s order and said it supported the creation of a fiduciary rule under the Securities and Exchange Commission, which could apply to all advisers not just retirement advisers. Wells Fargo said it would continue to work with regulators to ensure higher standards of care for investment clients. Other banks either declined to comment or were not immediately available to comment. Implementing changes was particularly tough for small-time financial advisers. Along with two colleagues, Juli McNeely, who runs McNeely Financial Services in Spencer, Wisconsin has spent between 45 and 60 hours each week since December preparing for the rule. Their work has focused largely on figuring out which clients from their rural community should now pay a flat fee for financial advice, instead of commissions, and creating new templates for paperwork. “Now we have a little breathing room to make sure we do this right and not quickly to meet a deadline,” said McNeely, who voted for Trump, in part because of his pro-business stance. One person who has yet to comment on the retirement rule review is the person who will be at the center of it — Trump’s choice to head the Labor Department, Andy Puzder. Puzder, chief executive of fastfood group CKE Restaurants, has been a vocal opponent of what he has called “overregulation” during the Obama administration. The 401(k) plans he offers his own employees are less generous than some rivals, suggesting a more industry-friendly approach. While the Labor Secretary cannot unilaterally repeal a rule, his agency can rewrite and change a rule substantially or scrap it. William Galvin, the top securities regulator in Massachusetts, described Trump’s order as “reckless”. “My office will continue to protect small investors when those in Washington cave to big business.” Not all proponents of the rule were as pessimistic. “There’s no question that in the minds of industry lobbyist, delay is just a step toward repeal,” said Barbara Roper, investor protection director for the Consumer Federation of America (CFA). “If the Department of Labor follows an honest process and considers the impact on retirement savers, we have a winning argument.” ",1
" The Nuclear Deal  became a Republican talking point as soon as it became inevitable that the Obama administration was going to move forward and try to do what no Democrat or Republican could do for 30 years: tell the Iranians to sit down and do as they re told so people can stop finding reasons to bomb each other.We were told from the beginning that Iran wasn t suddenly a friendly nation. We were told flat out that they support terrorism and that they have human rights issues and women s rights issues and all kinds of things to sort out. All of that being true is also the reason we couldn t just sit back and allow a potentially unpredictable rogue nuclear nation to decide to eliminate a neighbor, friend or foe.You see, we can t just have people nuking each other. When the deal was made the GOP immediately called it a giveaway. They rang up the total of how much the Iranian economy   and therefore its people   would gain with sanctions lifted and called that number the amount Obama was  giving to terrorists.  The amount of enriched product Iran would have left would be enough to kill Israel 50 times. They spewed lie after lie to make people afraid   it s what they do   of the very thought of Iran having anything nuclear at all within its borders.The Republican plan is simple: keep the sanctions on Iran, making them as helpless as possible on the oil market, and then start a war. It s just the next inevitable Republican War. If we elect a Republican president we can pretty much bank on it. Several candidates have said they would  tear up the deal  on their first day in office.Unfortunately for the GOP, Iran just surrendered its entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians. What little material they have left will be downgraded to fissionable reactor plates for an internationally supervised test reactor with zero capability of producing weapons-grade material.The transfer included tons of low-grade material that could have potentially been enriched along with the entire inventory of enriched uranium the Iranians possessed. At this point, the Iranians are reduced to a pre-nuclear industrial era where the only thing nuclear reactors do are experiments.That s what the people who listen to the voices of doom on stage at GOP debates don t get. There never was any way for Iran to get out of the stipulations of the deal. Their path to a nuclear weapon was cut off at the knees. This latest step to full implementation is yet another incredible win for a president who refuses to allow his legacy to die during his  lame duck  years.Featured image via Instagram",0
"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan president Carles Puigdemont is set to call a snap regional election, political allies said, a move that could help break a one-month deadlock between the Madrid government and separatists seeking a split from Spain. The uncertainty remained high however as Puigdemont who had announced he would deliver an address at 1.30 p.m. (1130 GMT), first delayed it by one hour and then canceled it, triggering speculation he could still change his mind. Several members of his pro-independence coalition said he would dissolve the regional parliament and call the vote. The regional broadcaster said he would deliver a speech in the assembly at 5 p.m., as had initially been planned.  Barcelona-based La Vanguardia said he would call the vote for Dec. 20 and was taking the decision in a bid to persuade the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy not to enforce direct rule in the region, which he might do as soon as Friday. The Catalan secessionist drive is Spain s worst political crisis since the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco ended in 1975. It has fractured society and hundreds of companies have left the region. It is also the most serious challenge to the integrity of a Western European country since an independence referendum in Scotland in 2014, when voters in the end chose to stay part of the United Kingdom. European leaders fear it could spur secessionist ambitions in other parts of the continent. But cracks appeared late on Wednesday in the independence coalition as some members backed an election while others said there was no alternative to independence. Within minutes of Thursday s developments, several pro-secession lawmakers and mayors announced they were stepping down.  I don t share the decision to call an election. I am resigning as a lawmaker and a member of PdeCat (Puigdemont s Catalan Democratic Party),  said Jordi Cuminal on Twitter. Several hundred people also took to the streets and gathered on Placa Sant Jaume, in front of the Catalan government s headquarters in central Barcelona.  Puigdemont traitor,  a big banner read. Far-left party CUP, a key support for Puigdemont s minority government, said it would oppose a vote.  Until now, pro-independence supporters had one problem: the Spanish state. If elections are called, they will have two,  it said on twitter. Demand for Spanish debt and shares jumped when it emerged Puigdemont could call an election. Spain s 10-year government bond yield - which moves inversely to price - fell 6 basis points to 1.58 percent on the news. The stock index IBEX rose 1.9 percent to a four-week high.  This news is positive for Spain because it looks like Puigdemont is looking for ways other than declaring independence,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.  It sounds like he is calling these elections so that Madrid does not have to invoke article 155,  that would allow central government to suspend the wealthy region s autonomy. It is not yet clear whether Rajoy will impose direct rule as planned or simply seek the Senate s authorisation to do so but stop short of making it effective. His government said earlier this week that calling a snap election would not be enough, and Puigdemont would also have to withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence he made on Oct. 10. An election could either strengthen Puigdemont s mandate if pro-independence parties won, or allow him a graceful exit if they did not. An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot, in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A leading European rights watchdog called on Turkey on Friday to ease post-coup state of emergency laws that have seen thousands arrested and restore power to regional authorities. President Tayyip Erdogan has overseen a mass purge in the armed forces and the judiciary, as well as a crackdown on critics including academics and journalists since a failed military coup in July last year.  An advisory body to the Council of Europe, of which Turkey is a member, acknowledged in a report  the need for certain extraordinary steps taken by Turkish authorities to face a dangerous armed conspiracy .  However...Turkish authorities have interpreted these extraordinary powers too extensively,  said the experts, known as the Venice Commission, in an opinion that has no legal force. It urged Ankara to lift laws allowing it to pick mayors, deputy mayors and members of local councils outside of local elections, a reference to rules the Turkish government has used to replace local pro-Kurdish politicians across the largely Kurdish southeast of the country. The experts at the Council of Europe, Europe s leading human rights organization with 47 member states, recommended Turkey set a time limit on the emergency rules and ensure proper judicial oversight of any counter-terrorism measures. Erdogan has accused U.S.-based, Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating the coup, in which 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied involvement.  Since then, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over links to Gulen, while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors. Rights groups and Turkey s Western allies - including the European Union - have been taken aback by the scale of the purge, sounding alarm that Erdogan was using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government in Turkey, a NATO member, says it must neutralize the threat represented by Gulen s network deeply rooted in the army, schools and courts. ",1
"College campuses are one of the places where free speech is extremely sacrosanct, and for that reason, they re also often the target of censorship attempts from the government. Right now, campuses are under attack because they re hotbeds for opinions and movements that politicians can t stand, and the Senate has decided to try and stop that.The bill sounds innocuous at first. It s called the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, and it s aimed at combating anti-Semitism, which has been on the rise thanks to Trump normalizing pretty much every form of bigotry there is. Combating anti-Semitism in the wake of his election through legislation is commendable.Combating it the way the Senate is doing, though, is not. What they saw in the rise of anti-Semitic sentiment and hate crimes here was not a real chance to address hate crimes and speech. They saw an opportunity to squash speech in favor of Palestinian rights in one of the places where it s strongest, and they pounced.This bill encourages the Department of Education to adopt the State Department s definition of anti-Semitism, which includes demonizing and delegitimizing Israel, applying double standards, and focusing on Israel only for human rights investigations.While the bill doesn t actually tell the Department of Education to use the language from the State Department, it does steer them in that direction. The Senate s hope seems to be that when they re investigating schools for anti-Semitic discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, they ll sanction schools with heavy anti-Israel sentiment.In fact, the definition is so broad that any speech criticizing Israel could be considered anti-Semitic hate speech, and thus, curbed lest the school get in trouble for daring to allow it.The Senate bill supposedly isn t meant to infringe on anyone s First Amendment right to criticize Israel, so long as they do it in the same way they would criticize any other nation. But we know how it ll actually be used. Groups like the Zionist Organization of America, AIPAC, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Jewish Federations of North America can t stand things like the BDS movement (boycott, divest and sanction) gaining steam. The Zionist Organization of America absolutely loves to file complaints with the Department of Education to try and silence any Palestinian rights speech on campus.That is only likely to increase if this bill becomes law. Students who fight for Palestine because Israel is guilty of murdering them for nothing, is guilty of forcing occupation and subjugating them, and is guilty of all manner of human rights abuses, already work in a heavily repressive environment. This will make that considerably worse.This has been simmering under the surface for a long time. Last year, Ted Cruz delivered a speech to AIPAC talking about how people involved with the BDS movement might end up in prison, depending on what s defined as legal and illegal protest behavior, and said that schools that support the BDS movement should lose their federal dollars.The University of California at Berkeley has faced tons of pressure to squash the BDS movement on their campus. And a student at George Washington University had campus police tell her to take a Palestinian flag out of her window.All of this is done under the idea that speech and expression in support of Palestinian rights are intimidating and frightening to Jewish students. However, a growing number of American Jews have a severe problem with how Israel abuses, oppresses and enslaves Palestine. Yes, it s a balancing act, but every right we have is a balancing act. In this case, the Senate wants to tip that balance towards censoring free speech. Do not expect them to stop there.The broader implication is that censoring pro-Palestine speech on college campuses could lead to censoring other speech on campuses. We do need to combat anti-Semitism along with other forms of hate. This, however, is just the Senate seeing their opening to end pro-Palestine speech on college campuses, likely with the hope that it ll die elsewhere.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",0
"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A federal judge has blocked parts of a new Florida law aiming to cut off state funding for preventive health services at clinics that also provide abortions, acting shortly before the restrictions took effect on Friday. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle issued a preliminary injunction late on Thursday after state Planned Parenthood affiliates challenged certain provisions as unconstitutional. Hinkle found the clinics were unacceptably targeted by state efforts to eliminate funding for other healthcare services they also provide, such as birth control and screening for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases. “The state’s only beef is that the plaintiffs provide abortions,” he wrote, noting that Florida already prohibits funding for abortions, as courts have held permissible. Florida is among many states adopting new abortion laws as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Supporters argued that the wide-ranging law adopted this spring in Florida would protect women’s health. It included restrictions similar to those in a Texas law that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down earlier this week. Planned Parenthood, however, did not challenge in its lawsuit a related provision requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a type of formal affiliation that can be difficult to obtain. The organization’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for Northern District of Florida, focused on the funding cuts, which it said jeopardized about $500,000 annually. Planned Parenthood also challenged a new requirement that state inspectors review 50 percent of patient medical records at abortion clinics. Hinkle’s 25-page injunction also blocked the additional inspections, noting that the volume requirements for abortion clinics far exceeded the standards for other medical facilities. “The inspection provision is a solution in search of a problem,” Hinkle wrote. In the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood also raised concerns about changes in how the state defines gestational stages. The terminology was clarified during a court hearing, said Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, who applauded the judge’s ruling. “This means this vital programs will continue to go forward,” she said in a phone interview. “Because anti-women’s health politicians want to end abortion, they went to the lengths of trying to stop these preventive services.”  The Florida Department of Health, named in the lawsuit, did not immediately provide comment. Neither did the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican. ",1
"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The latest test of a new North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is a provocative act, Russia said on Wednesday, calling on all sides involved to stay calm to avoid a clash. North Korea said it successfully tested a powerful new ICBM on Wednesday that put the entire U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. The latest test was the highest and longest any North Korean missile had flown, landing in the sea near Japan.  Certainly, this new missile launch is a provocative act, which provokes further growth in tension and which moves us further away from the point where a settlement of the crisis can begin,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters. North Korea s first missile test since mid-September came a week after U.S. President Donald Trump put North Korea back on a U.S. list of countries it says support terrorism, allowing it to impose more sanctions. Washington has said repeatedly that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea while stressing its desire for a peaceful solution.  Diplomatic options remain viable and open, for now,  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. While condemning the latest test, the Kremlin s Peskov said:  We hope that all the sides involved are able to preserve calm, which is so necessary to avoid the situation on the Korean peninsula sliding towards a worst-case scenario.  Russia and China have proposed a roadmap for defusing the crisis in the region.  On Wednesday, Russia s foreign ministry repeated its offer to use the plan, calling on North Korea to stop its missile and nuclear tests, while urging the United States and South Korea to abstain from their  unprecedentedly large-scale, unscheduled military air exercises announced to be held in early December . Asked if the Kremlin believed that the proposed roadmap was being considered by the North Korean leadership, Peskov said:  Let s put it this way: there are no grounds for substantial optimism.   ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former U.S. National Security Agency employee pleaded guilty on Friday to illegally taking classified information outside the spy agency that an intelligence official said was later stolen from his home computer by Russian hackers. Nghia Hoang Pho, who worked in the NSA’s elite hacking unit, retained U.S. government documents containing top-secret national defense information between 2010 and March 2015, the Justice Department said. Pho, a 67-year-old U.S. citizen born in Vietnam, faces up to 10 years in prison. He is not being held by authorities as he awaits his sentencing, which is scheduled for April 6, 2018, in U.S. District Court in Baltimore. A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Pho was the same NSA employee who had been identified in media reports for using Kaspersky Lab antivirus software on his home computer. Some U.S. officials have said software from the Moscow-based company allowed Russian intelligence agencies to pilfer sensitive secrets from the United States through Pho’s computer.  The Department of Homeland Security in September ordered federal agencies to start removing Kaspersky software from their computers. U.S. officials have said the firm either has ties to Russian intelligence or is forced to share information held on its servers with Russian officials. Kaspersky has repeatedly denied the allegations but acknowledged its software in 2014 took NSA code for a hacking tool from a customer’s computer before its chief executive, Eugene Kaspersky, ordered the code destroyed. The court documents do not appear to make mention of Russian intelligence agencies or Kaspersky Lab. The connection was first reported by the New York Times. The intelligence official declined to comment on whether  Pho knew the software he was using at home was vulnerable. Pho is at least the third NSA employee or contractor to be charged within the past two years on counts of improperly taking classified information from the agency, breaches that have prompted criticism of the secretive NSA. A federal grand jury indicted former NSA contractor Harold Martin in February on charges alleging he spent up to 20 years stealing up to 50 terabytes of highly sensitive government material from the U.S. intelligence community, which were hoarded at his home. In June another NSA contractor, Reality Winner, 25, was charged with leaking classified material about Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to a news outlet. She pleaded not guilty. And in 2013, former contractor Edward Snowden pilfered secrets about NSA’s surveillance programs and shared them with journalists. He now lives in Moscow. Pho, of Ellicott City, Maryland, took both physical and digital documents that contained “highly classified information of the United States,” including information labeled as “top secret,” according to court records unsealed Friday. He was aware the documents contained sensitive information and kept them at his residence in Maryland, the records said. Asked for comment, Pho’s attorney, Robert Bonsib, said, “Any conversations regarding this case will be made in the courtroom during the sentencing.” He declined to comment further. Officials at the NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The NSA, whose main mission is gathering and analyzing foreign communications for potential security threats, is based at Fort Meade, Maryland. ",1
"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Monday President Donald Trump was prepared to invest his personal efforts into Middle East peace if Israeli and Palestinian leaders were ready to be serious about engaging in the process. Tillerson, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, said a three-way meeting between U.S., Israeli and Palestinian leaders was for a “later date” rather than on this trip. ",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is heading into its home stretch, with major rulings due by the end of the month on President Barack Obama’s unilateral immigration plan, racial preferences in university admissions and a restrictive Texas abortion law. Producing decisive rulings has been complicated by the fact that the court has been down one justice since conservative Antonin Scalia died in February, leaving it evenly split with four conservatives and four liberals. The justices also are set to rule on whether to overturn Republican former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell’s 2014 corruption conviction, one of the 13 cases yet to be decided. The court appeared divided along ideological lines when it heard arguments on April 18 over whether Democrat Obama exceeded his constitutional powers in bypassing the Republican-led Congress with a 2014 plan to spare millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits. Twenty-six states led by Republican-governed Texas brought the lawsuit. A 4-4 ruling, which appeared to be one possibility after the arguments, would deal Obama a huge defeat because it would affirm a lower-court ruling invalidating the plan. Split rulings do not set nationwide legal precedents, but a 4-4 decision would effectively kill Obama’s immigration plan. The court also seemed split along ideological lines during March 2 arguments in a challenge to a Texas abortion law brought by abortion providers backed by the Obama administration. A 4-4 ruling would deliver a victory to Texas because it would affirm a lower-court ruling upholding the law. Because such a ruling would set no nationwide precedent, it might not serve as a legal blueprint for other conservative, Republican-dominated states to enact similar laws. The question before the justices is whether the law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a woman’s constitutional right to abortion as established in the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. There cannot be a 4-4 ruling in a challenge by a white woman, enlisted by a conservative legal activist, to a University of Texas student admissions policy giving preferences to racial minorities in a program aimed at fostering campus racial diversity. Only seven justices heard that case. Liberal Elena Kagan, the Obama administration’s solicitor general when it supported the university in earlier litigation, recused herself. That means four conservatives and three liberals will decide the case. Conservative justices expressed reservations about the affirmative action admissions policy during Dec. 9 arguments. ",1
"White House officials are now saying Trump won t make a trip to England this summer after a hurried, secret plan to sneak the president into the country was leaked to the English press causing widespread outrage.Trump s unpopularity in the United Kingdom is legendary, and his aversion to protesters has caused him to refuse to visit the nation until they can guarantee there won t be mass protests. But his staff apparently came up with a gamble that would allow him to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May while avoiding the backlash. Unfortunately for him, it fell through almost immediately.Trump wanted to visit his golf course in Scotland (because, of course) while he was in Europe for the G20 meeting and the plan was to have him quietly pop over to London so he could meet with May. To avoid any chance of protests, Trump s staff is said to have warned British officials that the president would only be giving 24-hour notice before dropping by. This way, they reasoned, protesters wouldn t even know he was in the country before he was leaving again.Whitehall sources confirmed the government had been warned that the president could visit Turnberry, one of his two golf resorts in Scotland, during his trip to Europe, between attending the G20 summit in Hamburg and joining celebrations for Bastille Day in France on 14 July.Trump would be expected to come to Downing Street to meet the prime minister for informal talks as part of any such visit, though final confirmation would be likely to be given with just 24 hours  notice to minimise the risk of disruption.But like everything with Trump s flailing administration, the plan leaked to the press and protesters vowed to be ready, even at short notice.So the White House is back to saying he won t be visiting our ally after all. At least not this summer.A spokeswoman for the US president said on Monday that no trip was imminent, amid mounting speculation that Trump was planning to make an unofficial visit to the UK on his way to or from the G20 summit in Hamburg this week. While we look forward to visiting the UK, it will not happen in the next two weeks,  the spokeswoman said.It s doubtful that the White House s denials are going to make any would-be protesters put their guard down. The Trump administration has such a deep reputation of lying, that a denial from them means absolutely nothing. It s likely that angry English citizens will gather at Trump s Scottish golf course while Trump is in Europe juussstttt in case. And Trump has a notoriously hard time resisting a game of golf.Meanwhile, Trump is getting ready to meet his on-again, off-again friend Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit. His advisers told CNN that the president is not planning to bring up the fact that Russia hacked the U.S. elections. Nevertheless, it will certainly be the elephant in the room.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0

"Donald Trump has one hell of a week. Starting off with his abysmal performance in last Monday s debate and ending with Saturday s New York Times  1995 tax bombshell. Trump is currently being lambasted for his manipulation of the tax system and his refusal to release his tax returns.Harry Reid has joined in with rest of the left and has arguably released the most scathing indictment of Trump on the matter of his taxes so far. Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won t release his taxes because they ll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father, Reid writes in a press release. Despite losing a billion dollars, Trump wants to reward himself with more tax breaks on inherited wealth while stiffing middle-class families who earn their paychecks with hard work. Damn, that s brutal. The U.S. Democratic Senate leader did not stop there. Reid continues, demanding that Trump release his tax returns and spells out very clearly what it means if the Republican presidential nominee continues to refuse to do so. Trump is over-leveraged and deeply indebted to someone, but until he releases his taxes we won t know who. The implications for America s security are severe. The American people deserve to know who has leverage over this man who wants to be president. In the name of the public interest, the Senate should immediately pass the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, which would force all presidential candidates to release their tax returns. If all senators agreed to pass this act for the good of the country, we could pass it in a matter of minutes. If the Presidential Tax Transparency Act were passed, Trump would be forced to release his tax returns. Let s step back and take stock: Senate Republicans have put party so far ahead of country, they ve endorsed a racist, incompetent failure who managed to lose a billion dollars in a boom year,  Reid writes.  Now they are helping Trump hide his tax returns and preventing the American people from knowing what individuals, businesses or foreign interests could have leverage over Trump. It s time we rip open Trump s closet and let the world see the financial skeletons he is hiding. The American people have trusted their officials to release their tax returns voluntarily. Trump is the first person in decades not to release his returns. He has proven that he cannot be trusted. Trump and all other future candidates  tax returns releases should be mandatory. Not only will it will be a small step forward towards a brighter more transparent democracy, it ll also make the financially corrupt think twice before running for office.Featured Image from Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the top officials at the U.S. Justice Department said Sunday that the agency’s heightened focus on policing leaks of classified information is not intended to put journalists in legal jeopardy. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein emphasized that the department’s renewed effort to prosecute leaks of classified information is not aimed at the news media. “We’re after the leakers, not the journalists,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We don’t prosecute journalists for doing their jobs.” But Rosenstein would not rule out potentially charging journalists in the future altogether, saying reporters could face charges if they deliberately violated the law. “Generally speaking, reporters who publish information are not committing a crime, but there might be a circumstance in which they do,” he said. “I wouldn’t rule it out if there were a case where the reporter was purposefully violating the law.” On Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that his department was tripling the number of investigations into leaks of classified information. President Donald Trump has been fiercely critical of the high number of leaks coming from the federal government since he took office. Rosenstein said the Justice Department has experienced a “surge” of referrals pertaining to leaks of government information. He also said that the department would pursue charges against “anybody who breaks the law” leaking information, including members of Congress and top White House officials. ",1
